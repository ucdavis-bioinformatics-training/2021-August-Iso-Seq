# Closing Thoughts

**The forest through the trees.**

## Prerequisites for bioinformatics

* Access to a multi-core (24 cpu or greater), ‘high’ memory 64Gb or greater Linux server.
* Familiarity with the ’command line’ and at least one programming language.
* Basic knowledge of how to install software
* Basic knowledge of R (or equivalent) and statistical programming
* Basic knowledge of Statistics and model building

## The bottom line

* Spend the time (and money) planning and producing good quality, accurate and sufficient data for your experiment.
* Get to know to your data, develop and test expectations
* Result, you’ll spend much less time (and less money) extracting biological significance and results during analysis.

## Next Steps

My recommendation is to follow all of the instructions again, from the beginning on your own and send emails to [training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu](mailto:training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu) And we will be responsive to answering questions

##  Upcoming Workshops

Now in our 14th year of training researchers, the UC Davis Bioinformatics Core invites you to attend one or more of our 2021 and into 2022 workshops. The following workshops are suitable for beginners, and are also of interest to those with data analysis experience.
